"""Composing a new scenario package from a map selection.

An operator draws a box on the map, the buildings inside become households, a second
selection becomes the area an order covers, and fire origins are placed by click. This
module turns that draft into the JSON files the simulator reads.

Two rules govern every path here.

A package directory is created or nothing happens. Writing into a directory that already
exists is refused, so a package a campaign has run against can never be altered by the
console. That is the only write path the console has into ``configs/``.

Buildings are the unit of selection and edges are the unit the simulator inserts on, so
the translation happens once, here, using the ``edge`` each building already carries in
its preview bundle. Nothing downstream has to know a building existed.
