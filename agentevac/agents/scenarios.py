"""Information-regime configuration and signal filtering for evacuation scenarios.

AgentEvac models three empirically motivated information regimes that differ in how
much official hazard information agents receive each decision round:

    **no_notice** — No official warning exists yet.
        Agents rely solely on their own noisy margin observations and natural-language
        messages from neighbours.  Menu items include route identity, travel time, and
        an observation-based utility score (local road knowledge), but no fire-specific
        risk metrics.  This represents the typical onset of a rapidly spreading wildfire
        before emergency services have issued formal guidance.

    **alert_guided** — Official alerts broadcast general hazard information.
        Agents receive a full fire forecast summary and per-edge risk data for their
        current location, but do *not* receive route-specific advisories or expected
        utility scores.  They must synthesize hazard information themselves.

    **advice_guided** — Official guidance provides route-oriented recommendations.
        Agents receive the full forecast, per-route-head forecasts, advisory labels
        (Recommended / Use with caution / Avoid for now), and expected utility scores.
        This is the highest-information regime and models scenarios with active
        emergency operations-centre support.

The key functions ``apply_scenario_to_signals`` and ``filter_menu_for_scenario`` strip
fields from signals and menus based on the active regime before the data is embedded in
the LLM prompt.  This ensures information asymmetries are faithfully reproduced.
