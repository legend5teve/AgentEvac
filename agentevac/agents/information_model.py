"""Information sensing and social signal processing for evacuation agents.

This module handles the two information streams available to each agent each decision round:

**Environmental signals** (``sample_environment_signal``):
    The agent observes the closest fire margin on its current edge and the minimum margin
    across the head of its planned route.  Gaussian noise (``sigma_info`` metres, std-dev)
    is injected to model imperfect sensing — e.g., smoke obscuring visibility or GPS
    inaccuracy.  An optional delay (``INFO_DELAY_S`` seconds, converted to ``delay_rounds``)
    is applied by replaying a stale record from the agent's signal history, simulating
    delayed emergency broadcasts or slow rumour propagation.

**Social signals** (``build_social_signal``):
    Peer messages from the agent's inbox are parsed with a simple keyword-vote approach.
    Each message casts a vote for one of three hazard states based on which keyword
    category is detected first (danger > risky > safe).  The vote tally is converted to
    a probability triplet that is later fused with the environmental belief in
    ``belief_model.fuse_env_and_social_beliefs``.

    Simulates imperfect environmental sensing (e.g., smoke, sensor noise, GPS error).
    The noisy observation is clamped by the natural arithmetic (can go negative, meaning
    the agent *believes* the fire has reached it even if it hasn't, or vice-versa).

    When ``distance_ref_m > 0``, the effective noise standard deviation is scaled by
    the ratio ``base_margin / distance_ref_m`` (proposal Eq. 1: ``Dist(s_t)``).  This
    models the perceptual reality that close fires are easy to judge while distant fires
    are harder to assess.  Setting ``distance_ref_m=0`` (default) disables scaling and
