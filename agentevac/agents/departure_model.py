"""Departure decision rule for pre-evacuation agents.

An agent waits at its spawn edge until this module's ``should_depart_now`` function
returns ``True``.  The function implements a three-clause OR rule:

    1. **Risk threshold** (``risk_threshold``):
       The agent's estimated danger probability exceeds its personal threshold
       ``theta_r``.  This is the primary, reactive trigger.

    2. **Urgency decay** (``urgency_threshold``):
       The urgency term ``gamma^elapsed_s * p_safe`` falls below ``theta_u``.
       As time passes, the discount factor ``gamma`` (< 1) erodes the "stay safe"
       signal so that an agent that has been waiting a long time will eventually
       feel compelled to act — even if ``p_danger`` is still low.  This captures
       the real-world observation that people eventually evacuate out of a growing
       general unease rather than a discrete danger trigger.

    3. **Low-confidence precaution** (``low_confidence_precaution``):
       If the agent is highly uncertain (``confidence < 0.15``) *and* the danger
       probability has reached at least 60 % of ``theta_r``, it departs
       pre-emptively.  This prevents agents from staying frozen in high-entropy
       situations where they should arguably err on the side of caution.

    """Evaluate whether an agent should depart from its spawn edge at the current tick.

    Applies three departure clauses in priority order (first match wins):
        1. ``risk_threshold``        : ``p_danger > theta_r``
        2. ``urgency_threshold``     : ``gamma^elapsed_s * p_safe < theta_u``
        3. ``low_confidence_precaution``: ``confidence < 0.15`` and

        4. ``neighbor_departure_activity``: recent nearby departures raise social
           departure pressure above the agent's trigger threshold while danger is
           already non-trivial.

    If none of the clauses fire, returns ``(False, "wait")``.

    Args:
        agent_state: The agent's runtime state (supplies profile parameters and creation time).
        belief: Current Bayesian belief dict with keys "p_danger", "p_safe", etc.
        psychology: Current psychology dict with key "confidence".
        sim_t_s: Current simulation time in seconds.
        neighborhood_observation: Optional system-authored local departure observation.

    Returns:
        A ``(should_depart, reason)`` tuple where ``reason`` is one of
        "risk_threshold", "urgency_threshold", "low_confidence_precaution",
