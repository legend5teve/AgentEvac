"""Run-level metrics collection and aggregation for evacuation simulations.

``RunMetricsCollector`` accumulates agent-level events over the course of a simulation
run and computes five aggregate KPIs plus one destination-share summary used for
calibration and cross-scenario comparison:

    1. **Departure-time variability** — Population variance of departure timestamps.
       High variability suggests agents are making nuanced, heterogeneous decisions.
       Low variability (everyone leaves at once) can indicate herding or over-reaction.

    2. **Route-choice entropy** — Shannon entropy over the distribution of chosen
       destinations/routes.  High entropy means agents spread across many options;
       low entropy means most converge on a single choice.

    3. **Decision instability** — Average number of times agents changed their chosen
       option across decision rounds.  Frequent changes suggest the LLM or belief model
       is producing erratic decisions; low instability suggests confident, stable routing.

    4. **Average hazard exposure** — Mean edge-level risk score sampled across all
       active vehicles each decision tick.  Proxies the cumulative fire danger
       experienced during the evacuation.

    5. **Average travel time** — Mean time from departure to arrival for agents that
       completed their evacuation during the simulation window.

    6. **Destination choice share** — Final per-agent destination commitments
       aggregated into counts and fractions for each designated evacuation point.

The collector writes a JSON summary to disk when ``export_run_metrics`` or ``close``
is called.  The file path is auto-timestamped to avoid overwrites across runs.

        For a household whose home edge the fire reached, the margin is

        while the household was still home.  For a household the fire never reached, the
        margin is undefined and the closest the fire ever came is reported instead, which
        keeps the metric informative on scenarios where the fire footprint stays clear of
        the populated edges.

        Each household falls into one status.  ``cleared`` left before the fire arrived,
        ``caught_at_home`` was still home when it arrived or never departed at all,
        ``never_threatened`` departed from an edge the fire never reached, and

            ``geometry_basis`` says whether homes were measured at the spawn edge or at
