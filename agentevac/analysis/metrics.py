"""Run-level metrics collection and aggregation for evacuation simulations.

``RunMetricsCollector`` accumulates agent-level events over the course of a simulation
run and computes five aggregate KPIs plus one destination-share summary used for
calibration and cross-scenario comparison:

    1. **Departure-time variability** — Population variance of departure timestamps.
       High variability suggests agents are making nuanced, heterogeneous decisions.
       Low variability (everyone leaves at once) can indicate herding or over-reaction.

    2. **Route-choice entropy** — Shannon entropy over the distribution of chosen
       destinations/routes.  High entropy means agents spread across many options;
       low entropy means most converge on a single choice.

    3. **Decision instability** — Average number of times agents changed their chosen
       option across decision rounds.  Frequent changes suggest the LLM or belief model
       is producing erratic decisions; low instability suggests confident, stable routing.

    4. **Average hazard exposure** — Mean edge-level risk score sampled across all
       active vehicles each decision tick.  Proxies the cumulative fire danger
       experienced during the evacuation.

    5. **Average travel time** — Mean time from departure to arrival for agents that
       completed their evacuation during the simulation window.

    6. **Destination choice share** — Final per-agent destination commitments
       aggregated into counts and fractions for each designated evacuation point.

The collector writes a JSON summary to disk when ``export_run_metrics`` or ``close``
is called.  The file path is auto-timestamped to avoid overwrites across runs.
